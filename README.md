# How do I approach designing software?

- What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

When it came to developing an application like this where we created a 3D scene, it was helpful to begin by taking a picture of a scene in real life, which then became the basis of the the scene that would be created in the application. 

- What design process did you follow for your project to work?

Once I knew how to program all of the various components to render objects in a 3D scene, I simple added the additional functionality for each different type of object. Then I simply told it where and how to render each object, and applied texture and lighting to each of the objects.

- How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

I think my biggest takeaway as it concerns the design approach would be that we can oftentimes use models or 2D images to give us a picture of what we create should look like. It can be a guide for how to layout objects in a 3D scene.

# How do i approach developing programs?

- What new development startegies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

Modularity. In this course, I was able to reuse many functions when creating various objects. For example, I could call UCreateTexture to create all of the different textures, then I only needed one UDestroyTexture function that I could call and pass in each different texture to be destroyed. Another example of this was for creating and destroying the various meshes.

- How did iteration factor into your development?

Iteration factored into my development by continually adding functions that were similar to each other but allowed for me to create different objects. Similarly, in the URender function, I continued to build upon this to draw each of the different objects. Essentially, everytime I added a new object to the scene, I had to re-iterate over the code and add the correct functionality for each new object to be rendered in the scene.

- How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project's completion?

Each week, I was able to apply what I learned to my project. By the time I got to the point of completing the project, I was left with only having to add the rest of the object's to my scene.

# how can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

- How do computational graphics and visualizations give you knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

I am not sure that my pathway will ever take me into the world of specifically working with graphics, but I do see how I could potentially use the knowledge I have gained throughout this course to display data in a visually appealing way.
